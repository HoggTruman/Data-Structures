WEEK 2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTIONS

-------------------------------------------------
1) make_heap

In this problem you will convert an array of integers into a heap.

-------------------------------------------------
2) job_queue

You have a program which is parallelized and uses ùëõ independent threads to process the given list of ùëö
jobs. Threads take jobs in the order they are given in the input. If there is a free thread, it immediately
takes the next job from the list. If a thread has started processing a job, it doesn‚Äôt interrupt or stop
until it finishes processing the job. If several threads try to take jobs from the list simultaneously, the
thread with smaller index takes the job. For each job you know exactly how long will it take any thread
to process this job, and this time is the same for all the threads. You need to determine for each job
which thread will process it and when will it start processing.
